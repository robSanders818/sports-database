# sports-database(defunct will release the schema soon)
A database of statistics in baseball, for batters, pitchers and team statistics

------------------------
## **How To Run This Assignment**
We were originally going to put this on the web and host the website off of a domain,
due to time constraints we decided that it wasn't really worth it and opted to just host it locally(though our actual database and DBMS is hosted in the cloud using the google cloud engine).

Requirements:
- You are going to need to have node.js installed on your computer.
- **You can download it here :** https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- **If you want to fork the project files(node.js not included) 
from github heres the link :** https://github.com/robSanders818/sports-database
--------------------------------
### Running the Web App

- Just cd to where the sports-database folder is located(in your terminal of choice).
- The terminal should looke something like this(The sports-database part is the most important). 
- ```C:\Users\broti\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\sports-database>```
- Type in ```npm install``` to install all the package dependencies
- Once you've done that just type in ```node app``` and the program should run
- To view your results you'll need to open a browser and go to ```localhost:5000/```
